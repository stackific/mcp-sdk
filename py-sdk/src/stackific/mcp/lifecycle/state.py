"""Feature lifecycle state model (§27.1).

Every feature governed by this document — any protocol message, capability, transport,
schema type, metadata key, or normative behavioral requirement — is, at any moment, in
exactly one of three lifecycle states. The allowed transitions enforce the policy in
§27.2 (see :mod:`stackific.mcp.lifecycle.policy`):

  - ``Active → Deprecated``   always permitted.
  - ``Deprecated → Active``   restoration permitted (R-27.2-n, §27.2 item 7).
  - ``Deprecated → Removed``  permitted only after the minimum window elapses (R-27.2-a).
  - ``Active → Removed``      FORBIDDEN; deprecation MUST precede removal (R-27.2-b).

This module is governance bookkeeping — these are conceptual records, NOT wire types.
The :class:`LifecycleState` constant set mirrors the TS ``const LifecycleState`` object
(a closed set of three string literals), exposed here as plain string constants on a
namespace class so callers can write ``LifecycleState.Active`` exactly as in TS.
